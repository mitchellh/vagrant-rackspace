    warn_insecure_ssh: |-
      Warning! By not specifying a custom public/private keypair,
      Vagrant is defaulting to use the insecure keypair that ships with
      Vagrant. While this isn't much of a big deal for local development,
      this is quite insecure for remote servers. Please specify a custom
      public/private keypair.
    warn_networks: |-
      Warning! The Rackspace provider doesn't support any of the Vagrant
      high-level network configurations (`config.vm.network`). They
      will be silently ignored.

    config:
      api_key_required: |-
        An API key is required.
      public_key_not_found: |-
        The public key file could not be found. Please make sure
        you specified a valid path.
      username_required: |-
        A username is required.

    errors:
      create_bad_state: |-
        While creating the server, it transitioned to an unexpected
        state: '%{state}', instead of properly booting. Run `vagrant status`
        to find out what can be done about this state, or `vagrant destroy`
        if you want to start over.
      no_matching_flavor: |-
        No matching flavor was found! Please check your flavor setting
        to make sure you have a valid flavor chosen.
      no_matching_image: |-
        No matching image was found! Please check your image setting to
        make sure you have a valid image chosen.
      rsync_error: |-

        error

    warn_insecure_ssh: |-
      Warning! By not specifying a custom public/private keypair,
      Vagrant is defaulting to use the insecure keypair that ships with
      Vagrant. While this isn't much of a big deal for local development,
      this is quite insecure for remote servers. Please specify a custom
      public/private keypair.
    warn_insecure_winrm: |-
      Warning! Vagrant is using plaintext communication for WinRM. While
      this isn't much of a big deal for local development, this is quite
      insecure for remote servers. Please configure WinRM to use SSL.
    warn_winrm_password: |-
      Warning! Vagrant has no way to store the Administrator password generated
      by Rackspace for later use with WinRM. Please configure Vagrant to use
      the same value for the winrm password and the Rackspace admin_pass so
      Vagrant will be able to connect via WinRM.
    warn_networks: |-
      Warning! The Rackspace provider doesn't support any of the Vagrant
      high-level network configurations (`config.vm.network`). They
      will be silently ignored.

    config:
      api_key_required: |-
        An API key is required.
      public_key_not_found: |-
        The public key file could not be found. Please make sure
        you specified a valid path.
      username_required: |-
        A username is required.
      invalid_uri: |-
        The value for %{key} is not a valid URI: %{uri}
      metadata_must_be_hash: |-
        Metadata must be a hash.

    errors:
      create_bad_state: |-
        While creating the server, it transitioned to an unexpected
        state: '%{state}', instead of properly booting. Run `vagrant status`
        to find out what can be done about this state, or `vagrant destroy`
        if you want to start over.
      no_matching_flavor: |-
        No matching flavor was found! Please check your flavor setting
        to make sure you have a valid flavor chosen.
      no_matching_image: |-
        No matching image was found! Please check your image setting to
        make sure you have a valid image chosen.

    states:
      short_active: |-
        active
      long_active: |-
        The server is up and running. Run `vagrant ssh` to access it.
      short_build: |-
        building
      long_build: |-
        The server is currently being built. You must wait for this to
        complete before you can access it. You can delete the server, however,
        by running `vagrant destroy`.
      short_error: |-
        error
      long_error: |-
        The server is in an erroneous state. Contact RackSpace support
        or destroy the machine with `vagrant destroy`.
      short_not_created: |-
        not created
      long_not_created: |-
        The server is not created. Run `vagrant up` to create it.
